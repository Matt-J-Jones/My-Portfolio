### Week 3: Databases:
**Learning Objectives:**
1. Design a database schema with at least two tables from a specification, including a one-to-many relationship between two tables, and create the schema in a database using SQL.
2. Use SQL to query a database to read data from one table or resulting of a join, create new records, update and delete.
3. Integrate a relational database to a program by test-driving classes which implement CRUD methods to send SQL queries to a database.
